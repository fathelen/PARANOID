PARANOiD Parameters
===================

Explanation of all PARANOiD parameters

.. _merge-replicates:

Merge replicates
----------------

Merges replicates into a single representatiove form. In order to do so experiment names need to named in a particular manner which is further explained in the  :ref:`[barcodes section]<barcodes>`

``Default: false``

Usage:
```
--merge_replicates
```


.. _barcode-pattern:

Change barcode pattern
----------------------

Adapt barcode patterns to different protocols. Default protocol is `iCLIP2 <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2019.10.003>`.
``N`` s represent the random barcode and ``X`` s the experimental barcode

Usage (default):
```
--barcode_pattern NNNNNXXXXXXNNNN
```
Example for iCLIP1
```
--barcode_pattern NNNXXXXNN
```

.. _domain:

Choose aligner
--------------

Choose between bowtie2 and STAR to be used to align reads to the reference sequence. Bowtie2 should be used for prokarytic organisms or transcript sequences while STAR should be used for eukaryotic organisms (or rather all splicing capable organisms) as STAR is splicing aware. If using STAR for splicing capable organisms it is highly recommended to provide an :ref:`[annotation file]<annotation>` file besides the reference.

Options:
| pro -> Bowtie2 (default)
| eu  -> STAR

Usage (default):
```
--domain pro 
```

.. _output_dir:

Output directory
----------------

Specify directory to which output generated by PARANOiD will be written.

Usage (default):
```
--output ./output
```

.. _min_length:

Minimum read length after adapter removal
-----------------------------------------

Specify minimum length a read needs to have after adapter removal to persist. Reads that become shorter during adapter removal will be filtered out.

Usage (default)
```
--min_length 30
```

.. _min_qual:

Minimum base quality
--------------------

Minimum quality for bases.
