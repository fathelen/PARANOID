PARANOiD Inputs
===============

Explanation of all outputs generated by PARANOiD

.. _output-alignments:

Alignments
----------

Directory that contains deduplicated alignments in ``BAM`` format together with an index file in ``BAM.BAI`` format. 
One of each is generated per sample.
Is included in the :ref:`basic analysis <basic-analysis>`.


.. _output-cross-link-sites:

Cross link sites
----------------

.. _output-cross-link-sites-raw:

Raw cross link sites
--------------------

Directory that contains unmodified cross-link sites with all background noise remaining. Cross-link sites are provided in 3 different formats, which are separated in one directory each; ``WIG``, ``BIGWIG`` and ``BEDGRAPH``.
Is included in the :ref:`basic analysis <basic-analysis>`.

.. _output-cross-link-sites-merged:

Cross link sites merged
-----------------------

.. _output-execution-metrics:

Execution metrics
-----------------

Directory that contains general execution metrics of the workflow such as: 

1. container_information.txt 
    Container system used to execute the processes together with the containers that were used during the workflow
2. execution_information.txt 
    Contains information necessary to reproduce the results such as 
        a. Command used for the execution
        b. Directory of PARANOiD
        c. Config file used
        d. Profiles used
        e. Version od Nextflow and PARANOiD
        f. Execution directory
3. parameter_information.txt 
    Contains all parameters used
Is included in the :ref:`basic analysis <basic-analysis>`.

.. _output-igv-session:

IGV-session
-----------

An ``XML`` file that can be transferred directly to the IGV.
This can be done by clicking on the *data* tab on the top left and then on *Open Session*. A window will open in which you can navigate to the output directory of PARANOiD and choose *igv-session.xml*. 
This will open a predefined IGV session that includes the reference, the cross-link sites of all samples (forward and reverse) and the alignment files of all samples.
If the option :ref:`-/-merge_replicates <merge-replicates>` was chosen then only the merged cross-link sites are shown.
Is included in the :ref:`basic analysis <basic-analysis>`.

.. _output-peak-height-distribution:

Peak height distribution
------------------------

Is included in the v.

.. _output-reference:

Reference
---------

The :ref:`reference sequence <reference>` provided as input. 

Is included in the :ref:`basic analysis <basic-analysis>`.

.. _output-statistics:

Statistics
----------

Is included in the :ref:`basic analysis <basic-analysis>`.

.. _output-strand-distribution:

Strand distribution
-------------------

Is included in the :ref:`basic analysis <basic-analysis>`.
