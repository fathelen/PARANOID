Basic usage of PARANOiD
=======================

Description on how to the minimal set of PARANOiD.
This means running it with only a :ref:`FASTQ file <read-file>` containing reads, a :ref:`reference genome <reference>` and
a :ref:`barcode file <barcodes>`.
Generated outputs include :ref:`alignments <output-alignments>`, :ref:`cross-link sites <output-cross-link-sites-raw>` in 3 different file types,
an overview of the :ref:`peak height distribution <output-peak-height-distribution>`, :ref:` processing statistics <output-statistics>`,
:ref:`strand distributions <output-strand-distribution>` and an :ref:`IGV session <output-igv-session>` which can be loaded directly into
thr IGV to visualize first results. A directory with the name output (:ref:`unless stated otherwise <output-dir>`) containing all results 
will be generated. 
All parts marked with <> are files that need to be specified by the user
