Analysis to determine if the protein of interest is prone to bind to specific RNA subtypes or regions. As this is determined via the :ref:`[annotation file]<annotation>` only subtypes included there can be determined (shown in column 3). To see which RNA subtypes are included in the annotation file a :ref:`[script]<determine_feature_types>` was added.
