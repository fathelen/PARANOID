Basic usage of PARANOiD
=======================

Description on how to the minimal set of PARANOiD.
This means running it with only a :ref:`[FASTQ file]<read-file>` containing reads, a :ref:`[reference genome]<reference>` and
a :ref:`[barcode file]<barcodes>`.
Generated outputs include :ref:`[alignments]<output-alignments>`, :ref:`[cross-link sites]<output-cross-link-sites>` in 3 different file types,
an overview of the :ref:`[peak height distribution]<output-peak-height-distribution>`, :ref:`[processing statistics]<output-statistics>`,
:ref:`[strand distributions]<output-strand-distribution>` and an :ref:`[IGV session]<output-igv-session>` which can be loaded directly into
thr IGV to visualize first results.
