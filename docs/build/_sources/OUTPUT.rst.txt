PARANOiD Outputs
================

Explanation of all outputs generated by PARANOiD

.. _output-alignments:

Alignments
----------

Directory that contains deduplicated alignments in ``BAM`` format together with an index file in ``BAM.BAI`` format. BAM files are compressed binary forms of SAM files. SAM/BAM files are tab separated and show one alignment per line.
The information shown by the columns go as follows:
1. Read header
2. Bitwise FLAG
3. Name of reference sequence
4. Position of alignment (1-based)
5. MAPQ-score
6. CIGAR string
7. Name of mate read (shows * if information is not available)
8. Position of mate read (shows 0 if information is not available)
9. Length of alignment on the reference (shows 0 if information is not available)
10. Read sequence (shows * if information is not available)
11. Quality of read sequence (shows * if information is not available)


One of each is generated per sample.

Is included in the :ref:`basic analysis <basic-analysis>`.

.. _output-cross-link-sites-peak-called:

Cross link sites peak called
----------------------------

.. _output-cross-link-sites-raw:

Raw cross link sites
--------------------

Directory that contains unmodified cross-link sites with all background noise remaining. Cross-link sites are provided in 3 different formats, which are separated in one directory each; ``WIG``, ``BIGWIG`` and ``BEDGRAPH``. Each format represents the same data.
Is included in the :ref:`basic analysis <basic-analysis>`.

WIG (Wiggle)
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Format to represent genome-wide coverage that consists of one line per reference chromosome with the coverage listed below each in a tab separated manner.
Column 1 represents the position while column 2 represents the coverage at the current position.
For each sample 2 WIG files are generated - one representing cross-link events on the forward ond one on the reverse string which can be distinguished by the name. The amount of cross-link events on the reverse strand is displayed as negative.

    variableStep chrom=reference_1 span=1

    3726    1.0
    3895    1.0
    6201    1.0
    6367    1.0
    variableStep chrom=reference_2 span=1
    22  1.0
    31  1.0
    66  1.0
    80  1.0


BIGWIG
^^^^^^
An extension of the previously mentioned WIG format. While WIG uses plain text BIGWIG uses a binary format to store the data, reducing the file size. Therefore, accessing the data requires specialized software such as the IGV. 

BEDGRAPH
^^^^^^^^
Similar format to WIG or BIGWIG. BEDGRAPH files consist of 4 columns:
1. The chromosome name
2. The start position of the described events
3. The end position of the described events (for PARANOiD this is the position of the actual cross-link event)
4. Coverage of currently described event

Visualization with IGV
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All provided file types can be easily visualized via the `Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) <https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/>`_.
To do so first the reference sequences need to be loaded into IGV. This is done by clicking on the tab called *Genomes* - which is located on the top left corner - and then choose the origin of the reference genome.


.. _output-cross-link-sites-merged:

Cross link sites merged
-----------------------

.. _output-execution-metrics:

Execution metrics
-----------------

Directory that contains general execution metrics of the workflow such as: 

1. container_information.txt 
    Container system used to execute the processes together with the containers that were used during the workflow
2. execution_information.txt 
    Contains information necessary to reproduce the results such as 
        a. Command used for the execution
        b. Directory of PARANOiD
        c. Config file used
        d. Profiles used
        e. Version od Nextflow and PARANOiD
        f. Execution directory
3. parameter_information.txt 
    Contains all parameters used
Is included in the :ref:`basic analysis <basic-analysis>`.

.. _output-igv-session:

IGV-session
-----------

An ``XML`` file that can be transferred directly to the IGV.
This can be done by clicking on the *data* tab on the top left and then on *Open Session*. A window will open in which you can navigate to the output directory of PARANOiD and choose *igv-session.xml*. 
This will open a predefined IGV session that includes the reference, the cross-link sites of all samples (forward and reverse) and the alignment files of all samples.
If the option :ref:`-\-merge_replicates <merge-replicates>` was chosen then only the merged cross-link sites are shown.
Is included in the :ref:`basic analysis <basic-analysis>`.

.. _output-peak-height-distribution:

Peak height distribution
------------------------

Is included in the :ref:`basic analysis <basic-analysis>`.

.. _output-reference:

Reference
---------

The :ref:`reference sequence <reference>` provided as input. 

Is included in the :ref:`basic analysis <basic-analysis>`.

.. _output-statistics:

Statistics
----------

Is included in the :ref:`basic analysis <basic-analysis>`.
